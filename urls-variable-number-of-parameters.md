# URLs with variable number of parameters {#urls-with-variable-number-of-parameters}

There are many cases when you need to get variable number of parameters via URL. For example one may want URLs such as`http://example.com/products/cars/sport`to lead to`ProductController::actionCategory`where it's expected to get an array containing`cars`and`sport`.

## 準備 {#get-ready}

First of all, we need to enable pretty URLs. In the application config file add the following:

```php
$config = [
    // ...
    'components' => [
        // ...
        'urlManager' => [
            'showScriptName' => false,
            'enablePrettyUrl' => true,
            'rules' => require 'urls.php',
        ],
    ]
```

Note that we're including separate file instead of listing rules directly. It is helpful when application grows large.

Now in`config/urls.php`add the following content:

```php
<?php
return [
    [
        'pattern' => 'products/<categories:.*>',
        'route' => 'product/category',
        'encodeParams' => false,
    ],
];

```

Create`ProductController`:

```php
namespace app\controllers;

use yii\web\Controller;

class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function actionCategory($categories)
    {
        $params = explode('/', $categories);
        print_r($params);
    }
}
```

That's it. Now you can try`http://example.com/products/cars/sport`. 你會得到：

```
Array ( [0] => cars [1] => sport)
```
