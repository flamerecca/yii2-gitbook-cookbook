# Using slugs {#using-slugs}

Even when pretty URLs are enabled, these often aren't looking too friendly:

```
http://example.com/post/42
```

Using Yii it doesn't take much time to make URLs look like the following:

```
http://example.com/post/hello-world
```

## 準備 {#preparations}

Set up database to use with Yii, create the following table:

```
post
====
id
title
content

```

Generate`Post`model and CRUD for it using Gii.

## 作法 {#how-to-do-it}

Add`slug`field to`post`table that holds our posts. Then add sluggable behavior to the model:

```php
<?php
use yii\behaviors\SluggableBehavior;

// ...

class Post extends ActiveRecord
{
    // ...

    public function behaviors()
    {
        return [
            [
                'class' => SluggableBehavior::className(),
                'attribute' => 'title',
            ],
        ];
    }

    // ...
}

```

Now when post is created`slug`in database will be automatically filled.

We need to adjust controller. Add the following method:

```php
protected function findModelBySlug($slug)
{
    if (($model = Post::findOne(['slug' => $slug])) !== null) {
        return $model;
    } else {
        throw new NotFoundHttpException();
    }
}
```

Now adjust`view`action:

```php
public function actionView($slug)
{
    return $this->render('view', [
        'model' => $this->findModelBySlug($slug),
    ]);
}
```

Now in order to create a link to the post you have to pass slug into it like the following:

```
echo Url::to(['post/view', 'slug' => $post->slug]);
```

## 標題改變處理 {#handling-title-changes}

There are be multiple strategies to deal with situation when title is changed. One of these is to include ID in the title and use it to find a post.

```
http://example.com/post/42/hello-world
```
